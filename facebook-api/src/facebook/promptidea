Improve text Analysis Prompt

 

 
 

    Value Propositions and Promises:
        Identify the unique selling points or promises that competitors emphasize to differentiate themselves,  for instance fast delivery, unbeatable quality, or unique features.
    Emotions and Engagement:
        Determine the sentiments competitors aim to evoke, such as humor, urgency, or curiosity, and whether they use interactive elements like questions to engage the reader.
    Language and Tone:
        Analyze the choice of language (plain vs. fancy terms) and the tone used (formal, playful, or authoritative) to understand the brand's persona and target audience.
    Calls-to-Action (CTAs) and Objectives:
        Identify the clear next steps or CTAs used in the ads (e.g., "Buy Now," "Learn More") to gain insights into later stages of the sales funnel and overall objectives.
    Problem-Solution Dynamics:
        Examine how competitors frame a problem and position their product or service as the solution within the ad copy, as this is a classic persuasion approach.
